The online book ordering systemâ€™s main purpose is to allow the user across various platforms to
be able to buy various types of books at a centralized place. Using a rating based
recommendation system will provide the user with a better knowledge of the popularity of a
book among other users. This might help the user while taking the decision to buy a particular
book. Books similar to the books that the user wishes to buy will be recommended which might
increase the sales.An invoice is generated after the purchase.

The admin can add, delete and update books from the database.
